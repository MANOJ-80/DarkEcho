DarkEcho: Secure & Anonymous Messaging App with Onion Routing
A detailed outline for building DarkEcho, covering project structure, components, and workflow.

1. Project Overview
DarkEcho is a secure, anonymous messaging app using onion routing and encryption to ensure private communication. It operates on Tor to obfuscate message origins and prevent surveillance.

2. How DarkEcho Works
User Registration & Authentication

Users register with a public-private key pair (no emails or phone numbers).
Authentication is done through cryptographic signatures (e.g., ECDSA, RSA).
Message Encryption & Transmission

Messages are encrypted using end-to-end encryption (E2EE) (AES-256 for symmetric encryption, RSA-4096 or ECC for key exchange).
Data packets are wrapped in multiple encryption layers and routed through Tor relays to hide the senderâ€™s identity.
Onion Routing for Anonymity

The senderâ€™s message is encrypted in multiple layers (like an onion).
It travels through Tor nodes (Entry Guard â†’ Middle Relays â†’ Exit Node).
Each node decrypts one layer at a time, only knowing the next hop, never the full path.
Receiving Messages

The receiver decrypts the message using their private key.
Messages are stored temporarily in RAM or a decentralized relay system (to avoid metadata tracking).
Self-Destructing & Ephemeral Storage

Messages automatically delete after a set time or upon reading.
No central database stores messages permanently.
3. Detailed Project Plan & Roadmap

Research Tor network, encryption standards, and anonymous messaging models.
Finalize programming languages (Python for backend, React for frontend).
Define threat models and security concerns.
Design system architecture and communication protocol.
Phase 2: Development Environment Setup
ðŸ“Œ Deliverables:

Set up GitHub repo & CI/CD pipelines.
Install Tor, Docker, and necessary libraries.
Develop initial prototypes for peer-to-peer encrypted communication.
Test Tor-based networking.
Phase 3: Core Functionalities Implementation
3.1 Secure Messaging System
ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
âœ… Develop a Tor Hidden Service to act as a messaging relay.
âœ… Implement end-to-end encryption (RSA + AES).
âœ… Create asynchronous messaging protocols for low-latency communication.
âœ… Build a key exchange mechanism for users to communicate securely.

3.2 Onion Routing Integration
ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
âœ… Implement multi-hop onion routing (Entry â†’ Middle â†’ Exit Nodes).
âœ… Develop a Tor-based peer discovery mechanism.
âœ… Test anonymity levels & resistance to traffic analysis.

3.3 Anonymous User Authentication
ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
âœ… Implement key-based authentication (No emails, usernames, or passwords).
âœ… Develop public-key cryptography-based login using signed challenges.
âœ… Secure against MITM, replay attacks, and impersonation.

Phase 4: Advanced Security Features
4.1 Self-Destructing Messages & Ephemeral Storage
ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
âœ… Messages disappear after reading.
âœ… Store messages only in RAM, never on disk.
âœ… Use Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) to prevent past messages from being decrypted.

4.2 Secure File Sharing
ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
âœ… Implement file encryption before transmission.
âœ… Allow secure document sharing over Tor Hidden Services.
âœ… Use SHA-256 checksums for integrity verification.

Phase 5: GUI & Usability Enhancements
ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
âœ… Develop a CLI-based prototype first.
âœ… Build a React-based lightweight UI.
âœ… Improve user onboarding with QR-based key exchange.
âœ… Implement multi-language support & accessibility features.

Phase 6: Testing & Security Hardening
6.1 Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Scanning
ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
âœ… Conduct black-box & white-box security tests.
âœ… Simulate traffic analysis and metadata leaks.
âœ… Implement rate-limiting & DDoS protection.

6.2 Performance Optimization
ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
âœ… Optimize Tor circuit creation time.
âœ… Reduce latency & improve message delivery speed.
âœ… Develop fallback mechanisms in case of network failures.

Phase 7: Deployment & Documentation
ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
âœ… Write comprehensive documentation for installation & usage.
âœ… Create one-click deployment scripts for self-hosting.
âœ… Release DarkEchoâ€™s first stable version.
âœ… Provide ongoing updates & security patches.
